[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

This sample is based on the fantastic article [Making a RESTful JSON API in Go](http://thenewstack.io/make-a-restful-json-api-go/) by [Cory LaNou](https://twitter.com/corylanou). You can find his code repository [here](https://github.com/corylanou/tns-restful-json-api).

Note: I will provide more detailed instructions after my //build presentation. If you can't wait and try this now, be sure to restart both the API App and the API App Gateway after setting up the `Local Git Repository` and committing your code.
